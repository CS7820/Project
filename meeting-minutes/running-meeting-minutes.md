* Narrative: 
    * From Cogan email:
        * > **Declan O'Sullivan** is a part of two of these. Maybe it's worth also digging further into his work more extensively. Anyway, these papers were relatively quick to consume.
        * > Anyway, there is research that says that **dilution of true facts with adversarial or false facts can obscure true facts within the dataset (kg)**. So perhaps one way of moving forward is â€“ **what is the threshold or ratio to which true vs. decoy becomes problematic in link prediction**. After that, the steps become more nebulous. 
            * What mechanisms are there to protect against poisoning? 
            * Does choosing a training set more carefully (or differently) matter? 
            * To what extent does the incorporation of false negative triples as couterfactuals during training negatively impact performance? 
            * Is there a way to make the KGE system "doubt itself" so to speak?
