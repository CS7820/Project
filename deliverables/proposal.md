# Problem Statement
Cogan: What is the problem? Provide brief background of the problem and generally motivate. Generally broken down
- Problem Statement
    - Research Question(s)
        - Falsifiable Hypothes[is|es]


# Background and Relevance
## Ontology and LLM
Ontologies provide data with context providing insight into knowledge which has been proven to complement LLM and their generative tasks in improving accuracy and reducing hallucinative effects<sup>[1]</sup>.

## Adversarial and Poisoning Attacks

### Cogan: Why NeSy AI?
Cogan: Why should this problem be solved with a neurosymbolic approach. Benefits, drawbacks.

### Cogan: Intellectual Merit
Cogan: How does this project extend the state of the art?

### Cogan: Broader Impacts
Cogan: Why is solving this problem broadly impactful to science and/or society.

## Proposed Methodology
The steps taken to address the problem statement.

# Methodology
We will investigate/develop...

by implementing a poisoning attack on data used by LLM.

# Expected Results and Significance
Our proposed research expects to:
1. a
2. b
3. c

Cogan: What are the "back of the envelope" results?
