# Problem Statement
Will adversarial attacks on the SCALES KG impact an individual's outcome?

Research Question in itself:  What is the threshold of affected facts to cause damage to a KG's performance?

# Background and Relevance
## Ontology and LLM
Ontologies provide data with context providing insight into knowledge which has been proven to complement LLM and their generative tasks in improving accuracy and reducing hallucinative effects<sup>[1]</sup>.

## Adversarial and Poisoning Attacks

### Cogan: Why NeSy AI?
The SCALES OKN exists as a knowledge base (knowledge graph). This is publicly available data that can be attacked via adding or removing facts from the knowledge base which directly affects KGE performance for predictive tasks in KG Completion (KGC).

The research is focused on the impacts of these attacks.

### Cogan: Intellectual Merit
Research into KGE and adversarial attacks on KGs.

### Broader Impacts
Societal:  KG attacks can affect the outcome of an individual's verdict of their case.

## Proposed Methodology
We will develop with the CRIAGE framework which provides an analysis for optimal candidacy list of facts to be attacked on the SCALES OKN.


# Expected Results and Significance
We expect the non-toy data set (SCALES) to reflect equal or better damages (a decreased performance of KGE) to a KG.

Our proposed research expects to:
1. a
2. b
3. c
